## Prerequisites

- [TF2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com/download.php)
- A Linux server running Ubuntu 
- A SFTP/SSH client
- Basic knowledge how linux works


### I will not go over how to connect to your server

## Step 1: Installing the sdk2013 server
- Move the TF2 Classic .7z file where you want your server installed
- Download the steamcmd package by running `sudo apt install steamCMD`.
- Run `steamcmd` and after its done run `login anonymous` in steamcmd.
- Run `force install_dir insert_full_path_here` in steamCMD to select the directory the server install into`.
- After you did that run `app_update 244310 validate` in steamCMD.
- Type `exit` to get out of steamCMD.

## Step 2: Moving files
- Install p7zip by running `sudo apt install p7zip-full`.
- Run `7z x insert_tf2_classic_name_here.7z` to extract the folder.
- Run `mv tf2classic insert_full_path_to_server_directory_here` to move the folder to your server`

## Step 3: Configuration
### All steps will be executed in the tf2classic folder, `cd tf2classic`.
- Generate config(s) on [cfg.tf](https://cfg.tf/server/).
- Move them into the `tf2classic/cfg` folder.

## Step 4: Running the server
### All steps will be executed in the server folder.
- Use any text editor of your choice to create `runserver.sh`, like nano, `nano runserver.sh`.
- Input `./srcds_run -console -game tf2classic +map pl_upward +maxplayers 24` (this is a example).
- Exit out of nano by pressing `strg (ctrl) + x`.
- run `chmod+x runserver.sh`

## Step 5: Create a user
- Run `createuser username_here` to create a user.
- Run `visudo` to open the root file.
- Insert `username_here ALL=(ALL:ALL)ALL`.
- Exit out of nano by pressing `strg (ctrl) + x`.

## Step 6: Running the server
- Change the user by running `su - username_here`.
- Run `cd full_path_to_server` to go to the server folder again.
- Run `./runserver.sh` to run the server.`

## Issues:
- I cant connect, what do i do?
##### your firewall probaly blocks the port, run `ufw allow 27015`, to unblock it.
